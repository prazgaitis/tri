# Tri

Tri is a workout tracking app that helps triathletes track and log workouts.

### Problem

It's hard to train for stuff, especially events like a marathon or triathlon. It's difficult to maintain a training schedule, to stay accountable, and to keep track of progress, let alone the actual training part.

### Solution

Conventional wisdom states that if you have a workout partner or a group, you are more likely to stick to your goals. Tri helps you stay accountable and accomplish your fitness goals by tracking your workouts.
 
### App Store Landscape

There are several workout tracking apps in the App store. The closest competitor is [Strava](https://www.strava.com/), a running and cycling GPS tracking app. Others include RunKeeper, Nike+, and MapMyRun.

### Features

- Track run/bike data with GPS
- Input swim workout details
- view friends' workouts and how you stack up
